# Movie_Recommendation_System
Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.

# Content-Based Recommender System
A content-based recommender system works on the data generated from a user. The data can be generated either explicitly (like clicking likes) or implicitly (like clicking on links). This data will be used to create a user profile for the user which contain the metadata of the items user interacted. More the data it receives more accurate the system or engine becomes.

# Collaborative Recommender System
A collaborative recommender system makes a recommendation based on how similar users liked the item. The system will group users with similar tastes. In addition to user similarity, recommender systems can also perform collaborative filtering using item similarity (like ‘Users who liked this item X also liked Y’).

# So how does Cosine Similarity work????
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

So we will be recommending Movies to the customer using User Based and Item Based Collaborative Filtering Model
